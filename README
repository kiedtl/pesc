PESC
====

PESC is a calculator, heavily inspired by Joy and `dc`.


Features
========

PESC is:

1. **practical**
   ...if you can stomach its alien, unintuitive syntax.
2. **extensible**
   ...provided that you don't mind programming in a dumbed-down version of
   Python made for people with severe brain trauma.
3. **stack-based**
   ...because everyone loves /bin/dc.
4. a **calculator**
   sort of. Maybe it's an esoteric language?

PESC is not:

1. a Wolfram-Alpha replacement.
2. a full-blown programming environment.
3. a scripting language.

Inspiration
===========

Pesc draws ideas from many languages/tools. Here is a non-comprehensive
list:

1. dc, a "reverse-polish desk calculator"
2. FALSE, an esoteric stack-based programming language that inspired the
creation of Brainf*ck.
3. FORTH, an imperative stack-based programming language that powered the
Philae spacecraft.
4. Joy, a purely functional stack-based programming language.
5. GNU bc, the omnipresent basic calculator
6. Nerdypepper's eva (https://github.com/nerdypepper/eva). If you don't
like stack-based languages, you should check this out.

There still remains a lot to be done. See the TODO file for more
